We used html because it is the easiest language to use for pages.
The combination of python and flask allows us to establish a server that takes in all of the different templates for the project.
We chose python because it is easily integrated with flask and also because it is one of the simpler language in terms of syntax.
We also use CSS to add style and flair to the html pages.

We chose to make the html sites look simple yet aimed to maintain consistency, which we achieved through a standardized style code and similar implementations across the board.
We organized the code intuitively based on the progression that a user would go through (based on the route).
We also organized the errors to be at the end of each route as well as at the end of the general application.py document.
